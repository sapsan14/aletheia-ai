## Email template

**Subject:** Proof for AI-generated decisions — Aletheia demo

**Body:**

Hello {{Name}},

When AI is involved in decisions, proving **what was said** and **under which rules**
is hard. This creates risk for compliance and audit teams.

Aletheia provides cryptographically verifiable evidence: signed responses, policy
coverage, and offline verification (no reliance on our backend).

I would love to show you a 5-minute demo and get your feedback.

If this is relevant, could we schedule a short call next week?

Best regards,
